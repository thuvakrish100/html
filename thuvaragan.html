The iPhone's nano-SIM card tray is made of aluminum.

The iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the iPhone 5, although the 5S received
a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and space gray/black, however the 5S has vastly upgraded
 internal hardware. The 5S introduced the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used
 on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 "motion co-processor". A redesigned home button with Touch ID, a fingerprint
 recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, was
 introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color
 temperatures.<br><br>
